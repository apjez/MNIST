## Key vocabulary
- AI (artificial intelligence): a computer that can think for itself
- ML (machine learning): teaching a computer to think like a person; code that we don't actually have to write and it does what we want
- NN (neural network): a machine learning model designed to function like a brain; connected "neurons"
- convolution: a mathematical operation
- CNN (convolutional neural network)
- processor: part of the computer that does the thinking
- CPU (central processing unit): main processor in a computer; typically 2-200 cores per CPU; very fast (3-5 GHz); access to a lot of memory (10s of GB to 1000s of GB)
- Accelerator: a specialized processor for a given purpose that runs faster than the CPU
- GPU (graphics processing unit): accelerator with 1000s of cores; slower (1-2 GHz) and less memory (10s of GB)
- TPU (tensor processing unit): specialized accelerator for ML; much more efficient
- memory
- cloud platform
- GCP (Google cloud platform)
